<h1>
    Chicago's Warming Centers: An Escape from the Cold
</h1>
<h2> 
    By Nora Rosenfeld
</h2>

<p>
    Chicago's cold, windy weather can make winter months harsh and painful, particularly for the city's large unhoused population, who don't always have the option of staying indoors to keep warm. Fortunately, the City of Chicago operates Warming Centers, where citizens can go to escape the cold.
</p>
<p>
    These Warming Centers are activated by the Department of Family & Support Services (DFSS) when temperatures reach 32°F and below.

    In March of 1983, the United States passed the Emergency Jobs and Humanitarian Act, which established the first major source of public funding to states for food and shelter. The funding was divided equally between a national board and states nationwide, with Illinois receiving $2.5 million in the first year. 
</p>
<p>
    In the first year of the program, services consisted of emergency shelter and food assistance. Over the years, however, services were expanded to include transitional shelter, and in Chicago warming centers and a toll-free homeless assistance hot-line.
