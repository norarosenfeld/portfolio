<h1>
    Chicago's Warming Centers: An Escape from the Cold
</h1>

<p>
    Chicago's cold, windy weather can make winter months harsh and painful, particularly for the city's large unhoused population, who don't always have the option of staying indoors to keep warm. Fortunately, the City of Chicago operates Warming Centers, where citizens can go to escape the cold.
</p>
<p>
    These Warming Centers are activated by the Department of Family & Support Services (DFSS) when temperatures reach 32°F and below. 
</p>
<p>
    On President's Day, which falls this year on Monday, February 17, many Warming Centers are closed for the holiday. According to the Farmer's Almanac, the mean temperature for this day historically is 11.1°F, a temperature which would generally trigger Warming Centers to be open. Fortunately, some Warming Centers will still be open, however, and some will be opening specifically for the holiday.
</p>
<p>
    This map includes the locations of all of Chicago's Warming Centers, and those open on President's Day are denoted with a star.

<h2>
    A History
</h2>
<p>
    In March of 1983, the United States passed the Emergency Jobs and Humanitarian Act, which established the first major source of public funding to states for food and shelter. The funding was divided equally between a national board and states nationwide, with Illinois receiving $2.5 million in the first year. 
</p>
<p>
    In the first year of the program, services consisted of emergency shelter and food assistance. Over the years, however, services were expanded to include transitional shelter, and in Chicago warming centers and a toll-free homeless assistance hot-line.
</p>
<p>
    Today, there are a few different types of Warming Centers, operated by different departments. The majority of Warming Centers are located in parks.
