</p>
<p>
    I am a third-year student at Northwestern studying Journalism and Global Health. I hope to have a career in the field of public health, and am planing to pursue a Master's in Public Health after I graduate.
</p>
<p>
    I am highly driven towards a career which allows me to help others in creative ways using my skills as a Journalist, as well as for data analysis. My favorite part about Journalism is interviewing people and getting to hear about and share their stories, and there are many great opportunities for this kind of work in the Public Health sector.

    Last summer, I was an intern with the Injury Prevention Program at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. During my time there, I was able to interact with patients and write about their stories, analyze data using Google Sheets, and complete a personal research project on environmental racism and neighborhood-based lead poisoning in the Los Angeles area.

    I have experience with coding using HTML and CSS for web design - I coded the entire website that you are viewing right now!
